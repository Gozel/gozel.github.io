								<button type="button" class="collapsible">PhD Opportunities</button>
								<div class="content">
									<p>If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send Gözel Shakeri an <a href="mailto:gozel.shakeri@envirofy.eu">email</a>. 
										State briefly why you are interested and include 1) your CV, 2) your publications list and/or your latest 
										thesis (e.g., MSc thesis or final year project report), 3) highlight the experiences and interests that are 
										relevant to the work we do with Envirofy, and 4) information about your grades so far. No need for a separate 
										cover letter or certificates.</p>
		
									<p>Apart from the open positions, there are scholarships every year offered by the University of Oldenburg, the University of Glasgow, public and private funders, and stipends.</p>
	
									<h4>University of Oldenburg</h4>
	
									<ul>
										<li>Have a look <a href="https://uol.de/en/promotingyoungresearchers/phd/phd-funding">here</a> to find out what funding opportunities exist at the University of Oldenburg.</li>
										<li>If you received your Master's degree in Germany, have a look <a href="https://www.stipendienlotse.de/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.stiftungen.org/en/home.html">here</a> for private and public funders / stipends.</li>
										<li>If you received your Master's degree outside of Germany, you are probably eligible for a <a href="https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/">DAAD scholarship</a>. Pay attention to the deadlines (usually 1 or 2 per year). </li>
										<li>Are you interested in a short-term visit? Check out <a href="https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/">DAAD</a> as they offer also short-term grants for students studying abroad.</li>
										<li>If you live in the European Union (but not in Germany!) or in one of the affiliated countries, you can apply for funding to <a href="http://www.hpc-europa.eu/">HPC Europa 3</a>. The grant will support your travel and living expenses and also provide you with the necessary computational resources to carry out your project.</li>
									</ul>
	
									<h4>University of Glasgow</h4>
	
									<ul>
										<li>Scholarships through the University of Glasgow: deadline for the opportunities below is 31 January every year. More info about the application process can be found <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">here</a>:
											<ul>
												<li>EPSRC Studentship: covers tuition fees at the UK rate and offers a monthly stipend. Non-UK students are eligible but note that tuition fees are paid at the UK rate, and not the international one, so you would need to fund the difference using other means. Deadline is 31 January every year. More info <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">here</a>.</li>
												<li>College of Science and Engineering Studentship: covers full tuition fees at the international rate and offers a monthly stipend. Deadline is 31 January every year. More info <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">here</a>.</li>
												<li>Excellence Bursaries: covers the tuition fees fully for UK students, and partially (£10,000) for international students. Note that this scheme does NOT include a monthly stipend, so you need to finance your life expenses using other means.</li>
												<li>Chinese Scholarship Council nomination: the School of Computing Science can nominate up to 4 candidates every year for the CSC scholarship. It is not guaranteed that the CSC will award our nominees, but historically this has always been the case. Our college then matches this funding to create a fully funded studentship (tuitions + stipend).</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Industry co-funded Studentships: if you are able to secure half the costs of a PhD studentship from a potential industry partner (currently set at £35,000), I can support you in getting match funding from the University of Glasgow to create a fully funded studentship (tuition fees at the UK rate + monthly stipend).</li>
										<li>Industry studentships: some companies offer scholarships. Examples include: Google, Adobe, Facebook, and Microsoft.</li>
										<li>Carnegie PhD Scholarships: highly competitive - more info <a href="https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/carnegie-phd-scholarships/">here</a>.</li>
										<li>SOCIAL CDT: The UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Socially Intelligent Artificial Agents (or SOCIAL CDT) funds 15 PhD students every year. Dr Mohamed Khamis is part of the supervision team. You would need to select one of projects listed on the SOCIAL CDT website, and apply before the deadline. More details about the eligibility criteria and deadlines can be found on the [SOCIAL CDT website] (https://socialcdt.org/).</li>
										<li>SICSA Research Scholar: <a href="https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/funding/students/">SICSA</a> can provide funding for PhD students currently studying Informatics and Computing Science within a SICSA institution to undertake studies and/or research via Summer/Winter Schools attendance and/or research visits.</li>
